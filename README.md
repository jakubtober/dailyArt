# daily-art
Simple front-end landing page created with Foundation framework for DailyArt app.

I have updated the project and created CMS for adding/removing new names (written in Django, JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX) and added REST API using Python Djago Rest Framework with names list which landing page is downloading in JSON via AJAX. It is available in the second branch.
